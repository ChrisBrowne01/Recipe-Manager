# Recipe Manager Project

## Instructions for creating a Recipe Manager project in Python

### 1. Set Up Your Project Structure

- [x] Create a Python script named recipe_manager.py.
- [x] Organize your project files into appropriate directories (e.g., data for storing recipe data files).

### 2. Define Recipe Data Structure

- [x]  Decide on the structure of a recipe (e.g., title, ingredients, instructions).
- [x] Implement a data structure to represent a recipe (e.g., dictionary, class).

### 3. Implement Core Functionalities

- Create functions to:
  - [x] Add a new recipe
  - [x] View all recipes
  - [x] Search for recipes by title or ingredients
  - [x] Edit a recipe
  - [x] Delete a recipe

### 4. File Handling

- [x] Implement functions to save and load recipes from a file using text or JSON format.
- [x] Ensure the data persists between program runs.

### 5. User Interface

- [x] Design a simple command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Recipe Manager.
- [x] Clearly display options and guide the user through the available functionalities.

### 6. Testing and Validation

- [x] Test each functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
- [x] Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., invalid user inputs).
- [x] Validate user inputs to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.

### 7. Documentation and Comments

- [ ] Document your code using clear and concise comments.
- [x] Provide a brief overview of the project and how to use the Recipe Manager.

### 8. Bonus Features (Optional)

- [ ] Implement additional features such as categorizing recipes, adding ratings, or supporting multiple users.
- [ ] Improve the user interface with colors or ASCII art.

### 9. Project Presentation

- [ ] Prepare a brief presentation demonstrating your Recipe Manager.
- [ ] Showcase the functionalities and explain how they were implemented.
- [ ] Discuss any challenges faced during the development process and how you overcame them.

### 10. Submission

- [ ] Submit your project files along with any necessary documentation.
- [x] Include instructions on how to run the Recipe Manager.

### 11. Additional Tips

- [ ] Break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time.
- [x] Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate if working in a group.
- [ ] Don't hesitate to consult Python documentation, online resources, or ask for help when stuck.
